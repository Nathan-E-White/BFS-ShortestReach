### Gotchas
NOTE TO WINDOWS USERS: Packaging the code into GitHub strips the (CLRF) line endings  usually seen in Windows files,
replacing them with the (LF) line endings usually used in Linux based OSs. You may need to restore these line
endings if you are getting strange bugs, particularly with the file <code>gradlew.bat</code>, if you are building in
a Windows environment. I currently don't have a Windows rig to test on, so YMMV.
